  h1 FreeCodeCamp API Basejump: Timestamp microservice

  blockquote User stories:
    ul 1) I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or
    ul a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
    ul 2) If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
    ul 3) If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

  h3 Example usage:
    br
    code https://aqueous-sea-47177.herokuapp.com/December%2015,%202015
    br
    code https://aqueous-sea-47177.herokuapp.com/1450137600

  h3 Example output:
    br
    code { "unix": 1450137600, "natural": "December 15, 2015" }
